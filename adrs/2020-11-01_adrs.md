# ADRs

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

I realise I'm making decisions and have not been recording them well.

## Decision

Add a simple ADR folder to the repo. Try to log each significnat decision
into a new ADR.

Date the filenames like `2020-11-01_adrs.md`.

## Consequences

This file and folder.
